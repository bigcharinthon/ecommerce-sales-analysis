## Key Insights

### 1. Monthly Revenue Trend
Sales in November are the lowest compared to other months. This decline may be due to the absence of promotional campaigns, as customers could be waiting for year-end promotions.

### 2. Low-performing Products
Products with low sales do not necessarily indicate poor product quality. Lower sales performance may be influenced by higher prices, leading to lower purchase frequency compared to other products. This suggests opportunities for pricing adjustments or targeted promotional strategies.

### 3. Repeat Customers
All customers in the dataset are repeat customers, indicating strong customer retention. However, this result may be influenced by the limited dataset size. Offering discounts or incentives for subsequent purchases could help increase revenue from repeat customers.
